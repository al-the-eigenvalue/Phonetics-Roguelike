### Overview:

This is a phonetics-themed roguelike game for a programming project. It is built with ___Python___ using object-oriented programming. The development followed this tutorial *(http://rogueliketutorials.com/tutorials/tcod/v2/)* and used mainly the ___tcod___ library, as well as some others.

### Features:

- enemies are represented with IPA consonants
- healing potions are represented with IPA vowels
- the respective sound is played when interacting with an IPA-themed entity
- 8 levels, each with unique enemies
- a save-load system with permadeath
- a level-up system with three skills to improve (health, force, defense)
- a unique dungeon generation algorithm
